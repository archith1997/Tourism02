                        Monon Community Center<br>
                        The Monon Community Center will reopen on May 24 or when Hamilton County enters 
                        Stage 3 of the state’s reopening plan, whichever is later. 
                        Initially, the facility will only be open by reservation for 
                        existing paid members age 15 and above. No new memberships or day passes will 
                        be sold until after July 4. Fitness equipment has been spread throughout the west building,
                        including on the indoor track, and a limited schedule of group fitness classes 
                        will be offered in the gymnasium, all to promote physical distancing between visitors.<br><br>

                        Parks, Playgrounds, Splash Pads + Restrooms<br>
                        Playgrounds, splash pads, and restrooms will open on May 24 in all CCPR parks and along 
                        the Monon Greenway, consistent with the state’s guidelines. The skate park 
                        and membership-based dog park, both located in Central Park, will also reopen 
                        on this date. CCPR will work closely with the City of Carmel to determine the 
                        appropriate time to reopen Midtown Plaza and the Monon Greenway between Main Street 
                        and Gradle Drive, although this is not anticipated to occur before Memorial Day.<br><br>

                        The Waterpark<br>
                        The Waterpark is expected to open on June 14 at no greater than 50 percent capacity, 
                        as required under the state’s reopening plan. Lounge chairs will not be provided by 
                        CCPR this summer, but visitors are welcome to bring their own folding chairs. 
                        Visitors are encouraged to bring credit cards to minimize the use of cash.</p>
